The output in the frontend can easily be modified and tailored to your needs.\r\n\r\n### Behind the curtain (*technical stuff, you don't need to understand this to use the extension*)\r\n\r\nThe extension is based on Extbase (namespaces etc.) and uses Fluid for templating. File relations are done using the [TYPO3 FAL](http://docs.typo3.org/TYPO3/FileAbstractionLayerReference/). All CSS files are generated via the CSS Preprocessor [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). The original SASS files are also included.\r\n\r\nAll CSS and JavaScript files are also minified for faster rendering. All minifications etc. are done using the streaming build system [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com).\r\nThe used gulpfile.js and composer.json ([composer](https://getcomposer.org/)) are also included in the download.\r\n\r\n***Sidenote: I recommand you include all CSS and JavaScript code in your existing files to have it all in one place.***\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\n### 1. Download\r\nDownload the extension. Extract and copy the folder \"ik_faq\" in your **typo3conf** folder.\r\n\r\n**OR**\r\n\r\nClone this repository into your **typo3conf** folder:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/ingokasch/ik_faq.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Activate the extension\r\nLogin to your TYPO3 backend, go to the extension manager and active the extension named \r\n**FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions // Ingo Kasch**\r\n\r\n### 3. Include static files\r\nUse the template tool and select the page containing your page or ext+ template from the page tree. Make sure you have **Info/Modify** selected in the dropdown at the top and click on **Edit the whole template record**.\r\n\r\nSelect the tab **includes** and add the extension files **FAQ (ik_faq)** to the selected items list.\r\n\r\nSave the changes ;-)\r\n\r\n### 4. Configuration\r\nCreate a new sysfolder (\"FAQ\" for example). This folder will contain all data related to the FAQs (categories, questions/answers, links etc.).\r\n\r\nUse the **Constant Editor** to edit the **PLUGIN.TX_FAQ** constants.\r\nSet the value of **Default storage PID** in the section \"Others\" to the id of the sysfolder that you have created right before.\r\n\r\nThat is it. Now the extension knows where to find the needed data.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# How to use it\r\n### 1. Category\r\nUse the **List tool** on the FAQ sysfolder and create a new record of typo **Category** (in the section *FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions // Ingo Kasch*)\r\n\r\nYour category needs a title and can have one, multiple or no images related to it.\r\nIf you have created any answere/question entries, you are able to relate them to the category using the **Entries** tab.\r\n\r\nThe following fields are available:\r\n\r\nFieldname        |Tab           | Function\r\n------------- |-------------| -----\r\nTitle      | General | Title of the category\r\nImages      | General      |  Images related to the category\r\n\r\n### 2. Entry (answers/questions)\r\nUse the **List tool** on the FAQ sysfolder and create a new record of typo **Entry** (in the section *FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions // Ingo Kasch*)\r\n\r\nThe following fields are available:\r\n\r\nFieldname        |Tab           | Function\r\n------------- |-------------| -----\r\nTitle      | General | Used as identifier in the select box in a category\r\nQuestion      | Question      |  Text of your question (RTE)\r\nImages | Question      |    Images related to the question\r\nAnswere      | Answere      |  Text of your answere (RTE)\r\nImages | Answere      |    Images related to the answere\r\nLinks      | Links      |  Links related to the answere (TYPE: Link)\r\nCategories      | Categories      |  Categories in which the entry is listed\r\n\r\n### 3. Links\r\nUse the **List tool** on the FAQ sysfolder and create a new record of typo **Link** (in the section *FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions // Ingo Kasch*)\r\n\r\nThe following fields are available:\r\n\r\nFieldname        |Tab           | Function\r\n------------- |-------------| -----\r\nName      | General | Used as identifier in the select box in an entry\r\nHref      | General      |  The URL\r\nTarget | General      |    Dropdown to choose where/how the link should be opened (<a  **target=\"{valueOfTarget}\"**...)\r\nEntries | Entries      |    Images related to the question\r\n\r\n### 4. Plugins (Frontend)\r\nThe Extension comes with 2 plugins **FAQ - Category navigation** and **FAQ - Show category entries**.\r\n\r\nPlugin        |Function\r\n------------- |-------------\r\nFAQ - Category navigation      | Renders a navigation of all categories\r\nFAQ - Show category entries      | Displays all entries for a selected category\r\n\r\nTo use a plugin choose the **Page tool** and select a page from your page tree. Add a new record of type **General Plugin** (found under the *Plugins* tab).\r\n\r\nIn the new record go to the tab *Plugin* and choose one of the two plugins in the dropdown list.\r\nRepeat the same step for the second plugin.\r\n\r\nDONE! Make sure to clear your TYPO3 Caches now and preview your page in the frontend :) \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Random stuff\r\nI want to provide a extension that is focused on functionality rater that a fancy styled frontend. The provided CSS and JavaScript files are just to give you an idea on how the frontend could look like.\r\n\r\nFeel free to remove the CSS and JavaScript files by removing the following lines in the **ext_tables.php**:\r\n```\r\n$GLOBALS['TSFE']->additionalHeaderData[$_EXTKEY.'css']...\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$GLOBALS['TSFE']->additionalHeaderData[$_EXTKEY.'js']...\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Languages\r\nThe extension currently supports the following languages in the front- and backend:\r\n\r\n- English (*default*)\r\n- German\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Bug or feature?\r\nIf there are any bugs or any features you would like me to add to this extension, feel free to open an issue on [this very Github page](https://github.com/ingokasch/ik_faq).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE V3","google":"UA-51448998-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
